### Hi there

I don't use GitHub much anymore, I self-host all my projects on my [Forgejo instance](https://git.funtimes909.xyz/Funtimes909)

I am Amy (Pronouns: **She/Her**)
I know **Java and Rust**
I use **Arch Linux (hyprland)**

### ServerSeekerV2

I'm currently working on a rewrite of the original ServerSeeker! A minecraft tool for scanning the internet for minecraft servers, it has some features the original server seeker didn't! Check it out in its repository [here](https://git.funtimes909.xyz/Funtimes909/ServerSeekerV2)
