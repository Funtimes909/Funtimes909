# Some goals

### Contributions To The Linux Kernel

Most of my time programming in rust will probably be to the [linux kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux) as thats my choice of OS and rust is starting to actually get some support in the kernel.

### Minecraft Server Software Written In Rust

Probably my most ambitious project, I'd like to do a full rewrite of the minecraft java edition server software in rust, with full support for most fabric mods. I've seen other people attempt this same thing but most projects seem to fall apart after sometime

A good starting place for this would probably be making a fork of [this github repository](https://github.com/feather-rs/feather)
