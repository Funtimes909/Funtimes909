### Hi there


I am Amy (Pronouns: **She/Her/They**)
I am a **beginner java developer**
I mostly do **Minecraft Mods**


### My Goals


Some mods I would like to work on in the future include the following:


### Mineshaft


Mineshaft will be a project between me and a few IRL friends that completely over hauls the game engine by including full multi-threading, A new, more optimized save level format and a few other performance improvements as I feel that minecraft as a whole is very unoptimized and laggy in general

Mineshafts main goal will be to be as efficent as possible without changing any vanilla behaviour and being as compatible with other mods as possible

This idea came about after I saw a lack of mods that added full multi-threading support


### Custom Launcher


I will be working with a friend of mine on a custom minecraft launcher desgined with a few things in mind: 

- Ease of use, 
- Ability to update all mods/resource packs from popular websites such as curse forge, modrinth and more
- Modpack browser 
- A way to prevent people from applying an Alex model skin to the Steve model
- A way to prevent players from applying their skin on the top layer meaning they will show up as a black square in the tab-list
- And a lot of smaller bugs that really annoy me about the vanilla launcher such as resizing the main window everytime the game crashes 
- Much better account system that includes and displays information such as the last time you logged into that account, name history and more
- Optionally a built in [namemc](namemc.com) browser

These are just a few ideas, New ideas are appreciated!

### Meteor Plus


Yes, I sometimes play Minecraft with a hacked client (Meteor Client), Mostly because of my hatred of pay to win minecraft servers and what they are doing to the community.
Meteor Client has a built in addons manager that allows you to create your own addons, I do not want to go to into detail about my ideas for it here as there is a complete list of my current ideas which can be found [here](https://github.com/Funtimes909/Meteor-Plus/blob/main/Ideas.txt)
